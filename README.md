Hurricane block cipher.

Just one of my first projects written in early 2005 :)

Is a symmetric block cipher with 128bit key and block length. 
Shown good results on statictic cryptographic analysis.
I even have forgot about it but found that it's used in Total Commander plugin.

Placing it here just 4fun.
